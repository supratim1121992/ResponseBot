# ResponseBot

This repository presents a demo for an automated response engine developed using an encoder-decoder sequential model with an attention layer. The overall solution design is summarised in the image below. <br>

To execute the demo two files shared on the following Google Drive links along with the qa_tok object provided here need to be downloaded and then uploaded to the user's Google Drive account. <br>
The ResponseBot.ipynb notebook can then be executed to generate results. A file with an example of the results is also provided here in the "Demo_Results.csv" file.
